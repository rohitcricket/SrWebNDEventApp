== README

This is an event to create events. This is built with Ruby on Rails as the backend. The reason for using Rails is the ease of using packages like Devise for user authentication and login/logout. The front end currently is minimal, but at a later stage I will add React or Angular to it. 

To run the program, if you have Rails installed, just type rails server and go to localhost:3000. At a later stage I will host it on Heroku. I am planning to incorporate the search function and also a map to it. Currently, I just want to submit the app so I can feedback on the rubric.
